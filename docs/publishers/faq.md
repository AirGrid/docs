# FAQ (Publishers)

### Does AirGrid need to be added to my `ads.txt`?

**No**, AirGrid augments bid requests with data and uses existing
platforms (SSPs) for the bid request / response flow and therefore is not
a new seller which needs to be added to your `ads.txt` file.

### Does AirGrid need to be added to my CMP?

**Yes**, whilst our solution does not extract user data off device, we still need
permissions to access a individual's device and also for the algorithmic decision making
process (segmentation). Our TCF ID is `782`.
