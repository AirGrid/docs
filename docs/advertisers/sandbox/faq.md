# PSB - FAQ

Welcome to the frequently asked questions! If your question is not here, do not

**What new reporting or insights will I receive as part of the beta?**

The Privacy Sanbox ARA is a replacement for 3p cookie based measurement with a
single goal, to make online attribution & measurement more private for web
users. In order to make measurement **more private** some loss of information
must be introduced. This means that we will be able to see and provide **less
information** than what has been possible using 3p cookies.

The goal of this testing period is all about:

- Understanding the amount of information loss.
- Optimising both on site and server side configurations to minimise the
  information loss.
- Creating a strategy to help clients mitigate any negative ROI impact from
  these changes.

**What data does the advertiser (conversion) pixel collect?**

During the beta period the PSB pixel will collect both:

- Dimensions which are collected by traditional cookie based pixels.
- Reports sent from the browser by the new Attribution & Reporting API.

The reason for collecting cookie based signals including a 3p unique user
identifier is to be able to run analysis to assess the differences between
traditional measurement and the new APIs.

Please see the full list [here](./pixels.md).
