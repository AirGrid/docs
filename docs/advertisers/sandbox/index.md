## Introduction

The [Chrome Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) is an exciting
development in browser technology. As the web moves towards a more private ads
ecosystem, the browser as the "user agent" is increasingly becoming the
custodian of your data. The Sandbox is a set of experimental APIs to allow for
basic advertising use cases such as targeting and measurement but done in such a
way that individuals cannot be re-identified.

AirGrid is built based on the same principle, **your data is yours and should
remain on your device**. We are therefore excited to be early testers of this
new technology and invite you to join us to run your advertising in a
privacy-focused and cookie-less manner!

**What the current beta supports**:

- View based conversion reporting.
- Integration with AirGrid **feed** audiences for automated optimisation.
- Collection of both event level and aggregate/summary reports.

**Current limitations**:

- Display campaigns only.
- Only the Xandr & DV360 DSP is supported.
- The reporting is not designed to replace your current adserver based reports.
