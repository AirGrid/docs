# Labs

Welcome to labs ðŸ§ª !

This is a very special place of the AirGrid platform where we experiment with
cutting edge techologies, ideas & features. This section is broken out from the
rest of the platform to allow for rapid testing of new ideas without the worries
of integration with primary workflows.

The each `lab` will be in one of the following states:

- Development: being actively worked on to extend the implementation with more
  features and/or improvements.
- Review: data is being gathered on usage both qualitative and quantatative.

We therefore ask all users of all the experiments to provide feedback, ideas &
suggestions wherever possible.

## Current `labs` available in the platform.
